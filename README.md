This is a small web project created with HTML5 which showcases fundamental skills such as HTML structuring, semantic tags and element linking.

It features individual pages for my three favorite recipes, where each page includes a photograph of the prepared dish, a description of the dish, and a step by step preparation guide with included ingredients list.
